# Distech Controls ECB-300

## **Overview**

The ECB-300 Series controllers are microprocessor-based programmable controllers designed to control various building automation applications, including HVAC systems like air handling units, chillers, boilers, cooling towers, and pumps. They also support lighting control and power measurement applications. The controllers utilize the BACnet MS/TP LAN communication protocol and are BTL-Listed as BACnet Advanced Application Controllers (B-AAC).

## **Description**

The ECB-300 Series controllers are engineered to provide precise control over HVAC equipment and other building automation systems. Key technical specifications include:

- **Universal Inputs**: 10 software-configurable universal inputs, with the first four supporting fast pulse counting up to 50 Hz, suitable for applications like gas, water, and electric meter readings.
- **Universal Outputs**: 8 software-configurable universal outputs capable of handling various control signals.
- **Power Supply**: Equipped with a 15 VDC power supply to support 4-20mA transducers, eliminating the need for external power sources for these sensors.
- **BACnet Objects**: Supports 2 calendar objects, 10 schedule objects, 30 PID loop objects, and over 300 BACnet objects, facilitating comprehensive control strategies.
- **Alarm Functionality**: Integrated internal alarm functions to promptly notify of any system irregularities.
- **Sensor Support**: Compatible with up to 12 Allure series communicating sensors, enhancing flexibility in environmental monitoring and control.
- **Wireless Capability**: The Open-to-Wireless‚Ñ¢ feature allows support for up to 28 wireless battery-less inputs, simplifying installation and reducing wiring requirements.
