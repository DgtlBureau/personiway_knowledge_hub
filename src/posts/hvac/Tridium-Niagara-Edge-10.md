## **Overview**  
The Tridium Niagara Edge 10 is a versatile, IP-based field controller that leverages the Niagara Framework¬Æ to provide comprehensive control solutions for various HVAC applications.

### **Description**  
The Tridium Niagara Edge 10 is an IP-based field equipment controller powered by the Niagara Framework¬Æ. It is designed to drive applications such as zone temperature control, fan coil unit operation, single-stage air handling units, water-source heat pumps, and more. The controller features 10 points of onboard I/O, including 5 universal inputs, 2 analog outputs, and 3 digital outputs. It supports expansion with up to four IO-R processors and runs the full Niagara stack, enabling integrated control, supervision, data logging, alarming, scheduling, and network management.
