# Distech Controls ECB-203

## **Overview**

The ECB-203 Series controllers are versatile devices designed for controlling various terminal units in HVAC systems. With 6 universal inputs, 5 digital outputs (TRIAC), and 3 universal outputs, they provide flexibility in system design. The controllers support BACnet MS/TP communication and are BTL-Listed as B-ASC, ensuring interoperability in building automation systems. Some models offer environmental protection with a conformal coating, making them suitable for humid regions.

## **Description**

The ECB-203 Series are microprocessor-based programmable controllers designed to control terminal units such as rooftop units (RTUs), fan coil units (FCUs), unit ventilators (UVs), heat pump units (HPUs), air handling units (AHUs), and chilled ceilings. They utilize the BACnet MS/TP LAN communication protocol and are BTL-Listed as BACnet Application Specific Controllers (B-ASC). These controllers feature universal inputs and outputs, making them suitable for a wide range of HVAC applications.
