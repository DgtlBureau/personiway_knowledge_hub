The Tridium IO-R-34 module enhances the JACE¬Æ 8000 controller by providing additional inputs and outputs, facilitating comprehensive building automation and control solutions.

### **Description**
The Tridium IO-R-34 is a remotely connected I/O module designed to expand the input and output capabilities of the JACE¬Æ 8000 controller. It features:

- **16 Universal inputs:** Type 3 (10k) thermistors, 0-100K ohm, 0-10VDC, 0-20 mA with external resistor
- **10 Relay outputs:** Form A contacts, 24VAC @ 0.5 amp rated
- **8 Analog outputs:** 0-10VDC

The module is powered by a 24VAC/DC source and can power up to four IO-R-16 modules. It connects to the JACE 8000 remotely over a shielded RS485 bus, allowing for flexible installation up to 4,000 feet from the controller.
