## **Overview**

The ECB-400 Series controllers offer versatile control for medium-to-large HVAC applications. With flexible inputs and outputs, onboard scheduling, alarming, and energy monitoring, they provide efficient system automation. Optional features include HOA switches and display modules, enabling local control and diagnostics. The controllers support Open-to-Wireless‚Ñ¢ technology, allowing wireless sensors and switches to be integrated easily.

## **Description**

The ECB-400 Series are microprocessor-based programmable controllers designed for HVAC and building automation applications. They control air handling units, chillers, boilers, pumps, cooling towers, and rooftop units. The ECB-400 supports BACnet MS/TP communication and is BTL-Listed as a BACnet Advanced Application Controller (B-AAC). Some models feature Hand-Off-Auto (HOA) switches and potentiometers for local control, and others include a full-color backlit display for easy operation.
