The Neptronic CMMB106 is an I/O expansion module that enhances BACnet and Modbus networks by offering additional supervised inputs and outputs, suitable for integrating non-intelligent devices into Building Automation Systems.

### **Description**
The Neptronic CMMB106 is a cost-effective I/O expansion module designed to extend BACnet and Modbus networks by providing additional inputs and outputs. It features 8 universal inputs, 2 digital inputs, 2 universal outputs, 2 analog outputs, and 6 digital relay outputs, all of which are supervised. The module supports BACnet MS/TP and Modbus RTU communication protocols, selectable via DIP switches, and allows for the connection of up to 2 STLD24 thermostats. Installation is facilitated by 10 override switches for manual control of each output, LED status indicators, DIN rail mounting, and removable, non-strip, raising clamp terminals.
