# Top 5 FSM Systems for Controls and HVAC Field Teams

Field service operations in **controls**, **HVAC**, and **BMS** (Building Management Systems) are evolving rapidly. Still, many engineering and technician teams face the same frustrations:

- No real-time visibility into job status.
- Technicians stuck on endless support calls instead of focusing on tasks.
- No built-in VoIP or field communication tools.
- No access to live documentation or schematics.
- Field engineers overloaded, with no clear prioritization.

This article explores **five FSM (Field Service Management) platforms** relevant to teams in building automation, controls service, and field tech support. Each solution is reviewed based on how well it handles documentation, dispatching, training, AI support, and team collaboration.

## 1. PersoniWay â€” Built by Techs, for Techs

**PersoniWay** is the only FSM solution in this list designed from the ground up for HVAC, BMS, and controls technicians. It's engineered for job speed, field intelligence, and zero confusion.

### Highlights:
- **AI-Powered Ticketing:** Create and resolve tickets from object drawings and floor plans.
- **Drawing-Aware System:** Pull up schematics, device info, or previous jobs in context.
- **Voice-Friendly Interface:** Hands-free ticket navigation and status updates.
- **Onboarding-Ready:** Speeds up training with built-in prompts and task support.
- **Live Progress Tracking:** Managers see real-time progress, not just "completed" logs.
- **Affordable Pricing:** Starts at $150/month. No hidden costs. Free integrations.

> "We built PersoniWay because weâ€™ve been on-site. We know what itâ€™s like to spend 95% of the time looking for the issue and only 5% fixing it."

If you work in **BMS or controls service**, PersoniWay is the field-first platform to scale your workflow without slowing techs down.

## 2. Fieldwire â€” Great for Construction Task Management

**Fieldwire** is a construction-focused platform designed to help project managers assign, track, and complete site tasks efficiently.

### Strengths:
- Task management tied to building plans.
- Real-time team communication and punch lists.
- Markup and annotate PDFs on mobile.

### Limitations for FSM:
- No native FSM workflow or ticketing.
- No AI or predictive guidance.
- Lacks service-specific asset linking and analytics.

Fieldwire is ideal for **general contractors and site engineers**, but requires significant customization to fit into a field service model.

## 3. Procore â€” Enterprise-Grade, But Overbuilt for Service Teams

**Procore** is a heavyweight project management suite for construction companies. It covers financials, documentation, and jobsite coordination.

### Strengths:
- Strong BIM and document control tools.
- Excellent integration ecosystem.
- Suited for multi-contractor environments.

### Limitations:
- FSM is not a core use case.
- Steep learning curve and overhead.
- Poor fit for reactive maintenance workflows.

If you're running a 500+ person construction business, Procore works. But for lean BMS service teams, it's overkill.

## 4. CameraCam â€” Visual Reporting, Not Full FSM

**CameraCam** focuses on visual field data â€” photos, videos, and voice tags â€” helping techs document work or send real-time updates.

### Strengths:
- Great for jobsite capture and annotations.
- Simple reporting from mobile.

### Limitations:
- No ticketing logic or technician workflows.
- Lacks integration with asset data or plans.
- Not built for dispatching or workload management.

A useful add-on, but not a primary FSM engine.

## 5. UpKeep â€” CMMS with Light FSM Capabilities

**UpKeep** is a Computerized Maintenance Management System that overlaps with FSM in industrial settings.

### Strengths:
- Asset-based ticketing.
- Mobile work orders and inventory tracking.

### Limitations:
- No drawing-based context or controls workflow.
- No hands-free or AI guidance.
- Better for manufacturing than HVAC/controls.

UpKeep is useful for factory maintenance teams, but misaligned with field-centric service work.

## Final Thoughts

For controls and HVAC field teams, the right FSM platform should:
- Understand device- and schematic-level work.
- Provide real-time ticketing with progress visibility.
- Support hands-free operation and dispatching.
- Help new hires get productive, fast.

**PersoniWay stands out** with its built-in AI assistant, field-first design, and support that doesnâ€™t stop at onboarding. If your engineers are stuck on calls, searching for documents, or overwhelmed with fragmented tools â€” it's time to switch.
