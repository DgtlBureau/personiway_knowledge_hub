# 🧰 Field Operations Automation Checklist

Managing field service operations — whether in HVAC, BMS, or commercial building maintenance — can feel like spinning plates. When you're stuck in endless spreadsheets, radio calls, or lost work orders, it may be time to stop firefighting and start automating.

This guide will help you understand when your team needs a smarter system — and what to look for in one.

## ❓When Should You Automate Field Operations?

Here are the most common signs:

| Symptom | What It Means |
|--------|----------------|
| 🧾 Lost or delayed tickets | Your team lacks a structured ticketing system. |
| 📞 Constant calls/texts | Dispatch relies on manual coordination. |
| 🔄 Repeating the same fixes | There's no feedback loop or data history. |
| 📉 No clarity on team performance | You can’t coach or analyze effectively. |
| 🤯 New techs take forever to train | Your system is too complex or undocumented. |
| 📂 Drawings live in someone’s Dropbox | You’re missing structured asset and site data. |

If two or more of these are happening — you're overdue for automation.
