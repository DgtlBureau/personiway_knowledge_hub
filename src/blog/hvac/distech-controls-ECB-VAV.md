# Distech Controls ECB-VAV

## **Overview**

The ECB-VAV Series controllers are designed to meet the requirements of diverse VAV zone applications. They improve energy efficiency when combined with motion detectors to adjust a zone's occupancy mode from standby to occupied upon detecting presence, and with CO‚ÇÇ sensors to regulate the amount of fresh air supplied to the zone, thereby enhancing occupant comfort.

## **Description**

The ECB-VAV Series controllers are microprocessor-based programmable variable air volume (VAV) controllers designed to control any VAV box. They utilize the BACnet MS/TP LAN communication protocol and are BTL-Listed as BACnet Application Specific Controllers (B-ASC). These controllers are suitable for various VAV applications, including cooling-only VAV boxes, cooling with reheat VAV boxes, parallel fan VAV boxes, series fan VAV boxes, and dual-duct VAV systems.
